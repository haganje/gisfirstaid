```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


This code shows how to map population flows between different locations. The code produces an interactive `leaflet` map with great circle arcs connecting origin and destination locations. It also shows how to save the leaflet map as a png file in case we want to get a static version of the map.
This post was inspired by the example that Nathan Yau shows [here](https://flowingdata.com/2011/05/11/how-to-map-connections-with-great-circles/).


# R packages

We will use the R packages `leaflet` to produce the map, `ggmap` to obtain the coordinates of the locations, and `geosphere` to obtain the great circle arcs between the locations. Then we will use packages `savewidget` and `htmlwidgets` to get a static png version of the map.
Data we will use is in the `epimaps` package.

```{r libraries, message = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(ggmap)
library(geosphere)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(webshot)
library(epimaps)
```


# Data

To make this plot we need two data.frames.

The first data.frame is called `loc_lat_long` and it contains the following variables:

- `locs`: code of locations
- `lat`: latitude
- `long`: longitude


The second data.frame is `origin_end_count` and it contains the variables

- `origin`: code of origin locations
- `end`: code of destination locations
- `count`: number people flying between the locations


In this example we will use the populations flows to Mexico from other countries in year 2009 that are in the dataset `Mex_travel_2009` from the `epimaps` package.
We will use the function `geocode` from the `ggmap` package to obtain the coordinates of the countries.

```{r datasets, message = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Countries of origin
locations<-as.vector(Mex_travel_2009[[2]]$country)
# Get coordinates of countries
long_lat <- geocode(locations)
# Create data.frame loc_lat_long
loc_lat_long <- data.frame(locs = locations, lat=long_lat[,2], long=long_lat[,1])


# Number people travelling to Mexico from other countries
number_people <- Mex_travel_2009[[1]]$MEX
# Create data.frame origin_end_count
origin_end_count <- data.frame(origin = locations, end = rep("Mexico", length(locations)))
origin_end_count$count <- number_people

```


# Calculate great circle arcs for each connection

We use the function `gcIntermediate` from the `geosphere` package to get the intermediate points on great circle arcs between locations, and store them as a `SpatialLinesDataFrame` that we will pass to the `leaflet` function.

```{r construct_SpatialLinesDataFrame}

listlines<-list()
for (i in 1:nrow(origin_end_count)) {

  # latitude and longitude of origin and end locations
  origin <- loc_lat_long[loc_lat_long$locs == as.vector(origin_end_count[i,]$origin),]
  end <- loc_lat_long[loc_lat_long$locs == as.vector(origin_end_count[i,]$end),]

  # Get intermediate points on a great circle between the two locations
  # We set  sp=TRUE to retrieve a SpatialLines object
  connection <- gcIntermediate(c(origin[1,]$long, origin[1,]$lat), c(end[1,]$long, end[1,]$lat),
                          n = 100, addStartEnd = TRUE, sp = TRUE)
  listlines[[i]] <- Lines(connection@lines[[1]]@Lines, ID = i)
  
}

sl <- SpatialLines(listlines)
sldf <- SpatialLinesDataFrame(sl, data.frame(count = origin_end_count$count))

```


# Plot

Now, we create a `leaflet` map with the connections. Lines are coloured according to the flow volume.
As the mouse passes over the lines, lines highlight and information about connections is shown. 


```{r plot}

pal <- colorQuantile(palette = "YlGnBu", domain = sldf$count, n=8)

labels <- sprintf("%s to %s: %s", origin_end_count$origin, origin_end_count$end, origin_end_count$count) %>%
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)
 
m <- leaflet(data = sldf) %>%
  setView(lng = -50, lat = 20, zoom = 2) %>%
  addTiles(urlTemplate = "http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png") %>%
  addPolylines(data = sldf, color =  ~pal(count),
               highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = "black", weight = 2), label = labels) %>% 
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~count, title = "Flows to Mexico, 2009",
            labFormat = function(type, cuts, p) {
              n = length(cuts)
              paste0(cuts[-n], " &ndash; ", cuts[-1])
              })
  
m

```  


# Save leaflet map as a static png file

Finally, to save the leaflet map as png we will first save it as an HTML file with the function `savewidget` from the `htmlwidgets` package, and then capture a static png version of the HTML using the function `webshot` of the package `webshot`.


```{r save}

saveWidget(m, file = "flowsmap.html", selfcontained = FALSE)
webshot("flowsmap.html", file = "flowsmap.png", cliprect = "viewport")

```
